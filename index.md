``You may NOT modify the plugin and distribute on to another place/source``

Xstats is a Multi-Statistics tracking plugin aiming to support pretty much all Source engine games.

### Featuring kill tracking, achievement tracking (module), session tracking, player connect/disconnect messages, player connect sounds, and even more to come. Aswell offers servers using unique Server ID's to read database tables, so you can have several tf2 servers for example using different server id's but still having same database tables.

### Xstats is not made to supersede any statistical plugins, it's just made for fun and improving skills.

### Influenced by gameMe & HLStatsX:CE (Community driven HLStatsX version) 

## This is a 'plug-n-play' type of plugin. Throw the plugin into the server, add the neccessary database.cfg lines to connect to the database and You're done.
